                <p class="info">
                    Water scarcity and drought are issues that already affect billions of people and will only be
                    exacerbated by climate change. Even more so, the most vulnerable populations are the ones who are
                    most at risk of losing access to clean drinking water. It is imperative to solve the water scarcity
                    crisis as this precious resource becomes scarcer.

                            An estimated 2.4 billion people lived in water-stressed countries in 2020, of which almost
                            800 million lived in high and critically high water-stressed countries.

                <h1 class="sub-heading">What is Drought?</h1>
                <p>
                    Drought is a complex phenomenon which is difficult to monitor. Drought impacts many sectors of the
                    economy and it occurs on different time scales. <br>
                    The 4 types of droughts and its causes are listed below :

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Meteorological Drought - Occurs due to persisting dry weather in an area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hydrological Drought - It happens due to low water availability in reservoirs, streams, and
                        depleted groundwater levels. This type of drought happens after many months of meteorological
                        drought.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Agricultural Drought - It occurs when crops are affected by droughts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Socio economic drought - It occurs when supply and demand are affected by droughts.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some of the measures that can be taken to control or solve the problem of drought are listed below :

                    <li>
                        Practice Rainwater harvesting
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Removal of dissolved miniral salts in water
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Use Drip Irrigation
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Plant Maximum Trees
                    </li>

                    <li>
